This  READ.md file is created in order to explain what is inside of a WT_CW1_00013663 rdepositery and how it was created. 
In this repositery, there are 6 web pages (main page is index.html), one file with css and one with Java Script, additionaly, there 18 images used in these webpages.

J'sCoffee - a website of a small coffee shop. 
This website was created in order to make life easier for people, and giving the opportunity not to go to the coffee shop itself, but just taking the phone and opening the site to be able to watch and order their favorite coffee from any location.

The website consists of six pages, which are namely, index.html, menu.html, about.html, special.html, shop.html and contact.html. All css and Java Script are written in one styles.css and script.js files, respectively. For all pages the same hover and footer is used, and only for contact.html page script.js was created and used.

All the .html (index.html is a home page), consists of a root (used as “header” in css) main body (used as “intro”in index.html, section with a class “about” in about.html, section with a class “menu” in menu.html, section with a class “about” in about.html, section with a class “special” in special.html, section with a class “section” in shop.html and section with a class “contact” in contact.html ) and a footer(used as footer). 

Only in the Contact section Java Script was used to make my page interactive. In all  other pages transition and transform (in some cases animation ) was used.
